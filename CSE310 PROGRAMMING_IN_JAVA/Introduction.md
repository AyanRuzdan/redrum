# Naming Conventions
All the letters of an identifier in Java should be in lower case, except:
> **Class Names**: First letter of each word in the identifier should be capitalized. Like `DemoClass`.
> **Method Names**:  First letter of each word in the identifier should be capitalized except the first word. Like `printMaxValue`.

# Identifier
A name in a program is called an identifier. They can be used to denote classes, methods, variables and labels. An identifier may be a descriptive sequence of uppercase and lowercase letters, number, or the underscore and dollar-sign characters. Like `number, Number, sum_$`.
> **Note: ** Identifier must not begin with a number.

# Keyword
Keywords are reserved identifiers that are predefined in the language. Cannot be used as names for a variable, class or method. All the keywords are in lowercase. There are 50 keywords currently defined in the Java language. The keywords `const` and `goto` are reserved but not used.  `true`, `false` and `null` are also reserved.

A user defined outer class can be either public or default. We can not define a private or protected class.
One file can have multiple classes/interfaces but out of them only one can be public.
